# Census Income Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Census Income dataset. The goal is to load, analyze, and visualize the dataset using different types of plots, as described below.


## Data Analysis

The following tasks were performed as part of this analysis:

1. **Load the Dataset**
   - The dataset was loaded from `census_income_dataset.csv`

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Three different types of plots were created to visualize the data:
     
     a) **Age Distribution of Respondents**
        - A histogram was used to show the distribution of respondent ages.
     
     b) **Frequency of Relationship Status**
        - A bar chart was used to visualize the frequency of each relationship status.
     
     c) **Salary Distribution by Educational Level**
        - A grouped bar chart was used to show the number of respondents earning `<=50K` or `>50K` within each educational level.

3. **Figure Compilation**
   - The three plots were saved as SVG files and combined into a single figure using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/de/).
